/*

  This test case makes sure that macaw can find functions only
  reachable via tail call.

  callee1 issues a tail call to callee2.  Note that macaw identifies
  callee2 as a function, but also includes its body as a block in
  callee1 (so that block appears in two function definitions).  That
  seems fine.
