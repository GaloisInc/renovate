-- | A wrapper around a 'RenovateConfig' that hides parameters and
-- allows us to have collections of configs while capturing the
-- necessary class dictionaries. The 'SomeConfig' is parameterized by
-- a constraint @c@ over the hidden 'RenovateConfig' params and a result type @b@.
--
-- * The @callbacks@ type is used to tell renovate whether it is running a code
--   analysis ('AnalyzeOnly') or a combined analysis + rewriting pass
--   ('AnalyzeAndRewrite').
--
-- * The result type @b@ is the type of results of the pre-rewriting analysis
--   pass.  It is parameterized by the architecture of the analysis in such a
--   way that there can be a list of 'SomeConfig' while still containing
--   architecture-parameterized data (where the architecture is hidden by the
--   existential).

--
-- Note that there is information encoded in the config for specific binary
-- formats (e.g., ELF), but the core binary rewriter is still architecture
-- agnostic.  Those extra helpers are used by the different binary format
-- backends in the core.
--
-- The type parameters are as follows:
--
-- * @arch@ the architecture type tag for the architecture
-- * @binFmt@ is the format of the binary loaded (e.g., ELF, Mach-O)
-- * @callbacks@ is the type of the callback in the configuration (the analysis only frontend and the analysis+rewriter frontend have different callback types)
-- * @b@ (which is applied to @arch@) the type of analysis results produced by the analysis and passed to the rewriter
